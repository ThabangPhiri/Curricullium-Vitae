I am a hardwork and fight to understand and have knowledge. My love for computers goes beyond birth I have always been passionate about what goes on inside a computer and I have been eager to learn and know more about computers in general.

                My education background goes far back from primary these were grades from 1-7 in these years I saw myself being exposed to computers and how they were going to change the future, we learnt to use computers at an early age and were exposed to what they can do for us, I then continued my high school career and that is where my love grew exponentially. Upon completing both my Primary and High School Education I took it upon myself to further my studies and study Information Technology in software development due to finances I was unable to further complete my studies.
